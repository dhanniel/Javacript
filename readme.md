Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not



Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined'

1. null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
2. undefined typically means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
3. null and undefined are falsy values.
4. null and undefined are both primitives. However an error shows that typeof null = object.
5. null !== undefined but null == undefined
